An add-on for Gravity Forms. Enhances the dashboard for Gravity Forms power users. 


== Description ==
 
Power Boost for Gravity Forms is a free WordPress plugin for Gravity Forms power users like me. I run this plugin on local copies of sites to make my job easier.

Features:

*   Adds 'Last Entry' column to forms list to indicate which forms are actually used.
*   Highlights forms rendered on the current page in the Forms menu of the Admin Bar. Adds forms that are embedded on the page to the list if they were not already present. Groups embedded forms at the top of the list.
*   Adds field IDs to the left of labels when viewing an entry.
*   Adds a Resend Feeds button near the Resend Notifications button when viewing an entry.
*	Reveals long form names that Gravity Forms 2.5 cuts off in the form switcher dropdown.

== Screenshots ==

2. Screenshot of an expanded Forms menu in the WordPress admin bar. The first two forms are highlighted with a different link color and a push pin emoji.
3. Screenshot of a single Gravity Forms entry. An arrow points to a field ID number that appears to the left of a field name.
4. Screenshot of a single Gravity Forms entry. An arrow points to a F Resend Feeds button near the Resend Notifications button.
